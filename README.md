A Smart Waste Dustbin is an innovative solution designed to improve waste management through automation and IoT-based monitoring. Traditional waste disposal systems often suffer from inefficiency, overflow issues, and irregular collection schedules, leading to environmental hazards. This project aims to develop an intelligent dustbin equipped with sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless communication modules to optimize waste collection. The system utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect the binâ€™s fill level and IR sensors for touchless operation, automatically opening the lid when waste is detected. Additionally, an IoT-enabled monitoring system sends real-time data to a central server, allowing municipal authorities to plan waste collection efficiently and reduce operational costs. The proposed solution promotes hygiene, sustainability, and resource optimization, making it an ideal choice for smart cities and urban waste management# Smart-Waste-Dustbin
